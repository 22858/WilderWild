-----------------
TODO:
- Finish dying forest
- Add snowy dying forest
- Add dying trees into normal biomes (more around clearings)
- Add dying mixed forest
- Add dying snowy mixed forest

- Added the Dying Forest - A fall-based luxury for all fall enjoyers! I think.
  - Contains many dying trees, dead trees, semi-dead trees, fallen trees, and a few alive trees, with slightly darker colors compared to a regular Forest
  - All regular Forest flowers grow here
  - Large mushrooms will generate here as they do in regular Forests
  - Bushes and Dead Bushes grow frequently here
  - Pumpkins will generate frequently here
  - Coarse Dirt mounds will generate here as well

- Added the Snowy Dying Forest - It got frostbite and died!
  - Contains only dead trees, semi-dead trees and fallen trees, also with slightly darker colors compared to a regular Forest
  - The only flower that grows here is Seeding Dandelions
  - Dead Bushes grow in this biome. Maybe "grow" isn't the right word...
  - Coarse Dirt mounds will also generate here

- Pumpkins generate much more frequently in Old Growth Dark Forests
- Changed the `Cherry Grove Placement` config to be disabled by default as it wasn't as immersive as anticipated
- Fixed the `Stony Shore Placement` config lang reading as `CStony Shore Placement
