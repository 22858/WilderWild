Please clear changelog after each release.
Thank you!
Put the changelog BELOW the dashes. ANYTHING ABOVE IS IGNORED

-----------------
- Refactored everything in the `misc` package to other places, removing the `misc` class.
  - This was done to prevent slander of our team.
- Added the Geyser to the Redstone tab, just before the Sculk Sensor.
- Substantially improved the Hollowed Log model thanks to Soulfate24! ([#379](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild/issues/379))
  - Previously, we were not able to figure out how to make a Hollowed Log model without the texture getting misaligned due to a vanilla bug.
  - The result was using a model comprised of only two parts, which messed up the breaking texture.
  - This new model fixes every possible issue with it!
- Updated Flowering Lily Pad textures thanks to Zhen!
