-----------------
Added the Ostrich
- Is tamed the same way as Horses, but takes a bit longer due to their feistier nature
- Instead of jumping, will attack with its beak depending on how strong the meter was charged
    - If its beak hits a softer block while trying to attack, it may get stuck temporarily
    - Added the `wilderwild:ostrich_beak_buryable` tag to control which blocks these are, currently containing the tags `minecraft:mineable/shovel,` `minecraft:mineable/hoe,` and `minecraft:wool`
    - Added a new `Ostrich Peck Attack` config option to control whether or not players can use the Ostrich's attack
- Can be bred with Bushes
    - Will lay an egg upon breeding
    - This egg does not require Silk Touch to be obtained
- Naturally spawns in the Savanna, Savanna Plateau, and Windswept Savanna biomes
    - Added the `wilderwild:has_ostrich` biome tag to control the biomes it spawns in
    - Added the `Spawn Ostriches` config option to control whether or not Ostriches will spawn naturally
- If hurt and not tamed, will chase after their attacker and peck them to death
    - If they are tamed, this behavior will only apply to other mobs
    - Will call other Ostriches for backup
    - While provoked, cannot be ridden or fed unless it's already tamed
    - If tamed and fed or ridden while provoked, will calm down

    - Contains only dead trees, semi-dead trees and fallen trees, also with slightly darker colors compared to a regular Forest
    - The only flower that grows here are Seeding Dandelions
    - Dead Bushes grow in this biome. Maybe "grow" isn't the right word...
    - Coarse Dirt mounds will also generate here

- Added the Dying Mixed Forest - I couldn't think of anything for this one!
    - Contains the same dying, dead, semi-dead, and fallen trees as the Dying Forest, now with some very alive Spruces thrown in!

    - Dead Bushes will generate here

- Potted Small Dripleaves now use their loot table (renamed `wilderwild:blocks/potted_small.dripleaf` to `wilderwild:blocks/potted_small_dripleaf`)
