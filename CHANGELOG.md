  - This adds a structure processor to convert the Jungle wood set into the Palm wood set.
- Fixed some modified recipes/loot tables not working properly.
- Converted Wilder Wild's entity registry to use Vanilla's entity builder.
- Reorganized data generation for configured and placed features in caves into their own classes.
