-----------------
- Fixed Termites causing extreme performance issues on clients in 1.21.5.
- Slightly reworked Termite sounds, using the SoundInstance itself to swap between sounds instead of logic within the Block Entity.
- Updated how rendering of Snowlogged blocks is handled.
- Updated how Wilder Wild detects if the `MC Live Tendrils` internal resource pack is enabled, no longer relying on an empty texture being loaded.
