-----------------
- Fixed a bug that let the top layer of water render inside of Mesoglea again.
- Slightly optimized shadow rendering.
- Fixed Nematocyst rendering.
  - Nematocyst rendering has finally been fixed with Sodium on all versions!
  - Nematocyst rendering has been fixed with the Vanilla renderer on all versions!
    - Do note that this had already worked fine on Vanilla 1.21.1 and below, so players using these versions without Sodium will not notice a difference.
