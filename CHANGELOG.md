- If its beak hits the ground while trying to attack, it may get stuck temporarily
- Can be bred with Bushes
    - Will lay an egg upon breeding

- Added Bush, Tumbleweed, Tumbleweed Stem, Milkweed, Datura, Cattail, Flowering Lily Pad, Algae, Shelf Fungus, Small Sponge, Prickly Pear Cactus, and Nematocyst blocks to the `minecraft:sword_efficient` tag
