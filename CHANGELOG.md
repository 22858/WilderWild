# Bug Fixes
- Fixed a few tags that were still unfinished and excluded the Palm set.
- Fixed the Carnation's dye recipe being in the `orange_dye` group.
- Cherry particles are now much more responsive to wind, and no longer get removed upon spawning.
- Wilder Wild's custom Sign types are now placed after the Mangrove Hanging Sign in the creative inventory, instead of between the Mangrove Sign and Mangrove Hanging Sign.
