Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear this after each release

What's new:
-----------------
- Added the Crab!
    - Crabs are neutral mobs that spawn in areas with large amounts of water and have a big Claw.
    - If no players are close to it and it's not been disturbed for a while, the Crab will hide in the ground.
    - If a player comes nearby or a loud vibration occurs, the Crab will come back out of hiding.
    - When attacked, the Crab will run towards its attacker and call all other Crabs nearby, even those in hiding, for backup.
    - Baby Crabs cannot attack, and will instead panic.
    - Can be bred with Kelp.
    - Can climb up walls.
    - Can be scooped up in Buckets.
- Fixed Jellyfish no longer spawning in Jellyfish Caves.
- Slightly sped up Rainbow Jellyfish rendering.
