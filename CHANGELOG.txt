Put changelog here:
-----------------
- Reworked and optimized most of Sculk Spreading.
- Sculk Veins will no longer stay on Slabs and Stairs after being converted to Sculk Slabs and Sculk Stairs.
- Sculk Sensors, Sculk Shriekers, Hanging Tendrils, and Osseous Sculk can now grow out of solid faces of Sculk Slabs and Sculk Stairs.
- Changed Osseous Sculk's rotation state from Axis to Facing.
- Removed Minecraft Live Sculk Sensor Tendril config in favor of a cleaner and bug-free implementation using a Resource Pack.
- Added Suspicious Gravel to Ancient Cities. Get your brushes ready and rip off your eyelids!
- Added Stone Chests in Ancient Cities' centers.
- Added a "tomb" to Ancient Cities' centers.
- Tweaked the rarity of Ancient Horn Fragments.
- Added Osseous Sculk and Hanging Tendrils to Ancient Cities' loot tables.
- Removed Stone Chest Closes gamerule as it caused issues in multiplayer.
- Cherry Groves now occasionally generate near rivers.
    - This change was made to maintain parity with some of Mojang's promotional material.
    - Alongside this change, Cherry Groves now generate Sand Beta Beaches.
- Added Shrubs to many biomes like Plains, Forest, Dark Forest, and much more.
- Added more flora to the Plains, Meadow, Flower Forest, Flower Field, Forest, Semi-Birch Forest, Birch Forest, and Mangrove Swamp biomes.
- Cattails can now generate on Mud blocks if not nearby water.
- Palms now rarely generate on Beaches.
- Added Snapped variants of trees.
- Forest biomes now have clearings, with Rooted Dirt and Coarse Dirt/Gravel surrounding it.
    - Snapped Trees will generate more frequently in clearings.
    - Flowers will generate more commonly in clearings in Forest and Birch Forest biomes and their variants.
- Reworked Fallen Tree generation once more.
    - Most Fallen Trees now generate with full Logs, though have a small chance to generate with Hollowed Logs.
    - As long as the ending of the Tree is on solid ground or above 50% of the Tree is on solid ground, the Fallen Tree will generate.
        - Previously, when a Fallen Tree wasn't above solid ground its remaining height would decrease, and once above roughly two or more non-solid blocks, its generation would cease completely.
        - This change helps Fallen Trees not generate and end up extremely short, and makes them a lot more realistic.
- Mangrove Swamps have now been wilder-ified, including Cattails, Flowers, Bushes, Mud Basins, Mud Lakes, more Grass, Fern, and rare Mud Piles.
- Made path features look more natural.
- Added new rare Coarse Dirt, Gravel, and Stone paths throughout the world.
- Decreased the size of uncommon Algae patches (Swamp & Mangrove Swamp.)
- Removed Deepslate Pools in favor of regular Stone Pools, which now no longer change the bordering block of the pools.
- Oceans and Rivers now generate small pools to increase the area covered in water, allowing previously dry areas above sea level to have a bit of water.
- Grass generates more frequently on exposed areas of Ocean and River biomes.
- Replaced Oak trees in Ocean and River biomes with Shrubs.
- Incorporated Wilder Wild's new foods, mobs, and biomes into Vanilla's advancements (note that this may be overriden by other mods' data).
- Jellyfish can now reproduce.
    - Repeatedly feeding a Jellyfish Cod or Salmon will eventually cause a baby Jellyfish to spawn.
    - Holding Cod or Salmon will cause nearby Jellyfish to follow you.
- Baby Jellyfish will only inflict 1 damage (half a heart) as opposed to three (a heart and a half.)
- Bubbles will occasionally spawn behind adult Jellyfish as they swim.
