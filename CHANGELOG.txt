Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear this after each release

What's new:
-----------------
- Added Mesoglea Bubble Columns.
- Axes no longer attempt to interact with every block, which previously prevented interaction with offhand items.
- Sodium now properly renders Mesoglea with the liquid rendering option enabled.
- Stone chests can no longer be interacted with via the Fabric Transfer API.
- Prickly Pears are now accounted for as "dangerous blocks" when pathfinding, just like regular Cacti.
- Removed changes to the Make Bubbles Pop mod as it switched strictly to mixins.
- Wilder Wild's leaves now use the same color as Vanilla's leaves on the map.
- Small Sponges now use Vanilla's Sponge sounds as opposed to Wet Grass sounds.
- Removed embedded Nbt Crafting
