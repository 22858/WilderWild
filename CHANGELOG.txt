Hello
Put changelog in plain text please
Make sure to clear this after each release

What's new:
-----------------
- Added the Crab!
    - Crabs are neutral mobs that spawn in Mangrove Swamps, Warm Oceans, Lukewarm Oceans, Deep Lukewarm Oceans, Oceans, Deep Oceans, Warm Beaches, Beaches, and Cypress Wetlands.
    - If no players are close to a Crab and it's not been disturbed for a while, the Crab will hide in the ground.
    - If a player comes nearby or a loud vibration occurs, the Crab will come back out of hiding.
    - When attacked, the Crab will run towards its attacker and call all other Crabs nearby, even those in hiding, for backup.
    - Baby Crabs cannot attack, and will instead panic.
    - Can be bred with Kelp.
    - Can climb up walls.
    - Can be scooped up in Buckets.
    - Will drop its Claw upon death, which can be cooked.

- Removed the Fabric Loader version requirement in hopes it will fix issues with Quilt.
- Changed the grammar of Wilder Wild's advancements to align with Vanilla.
- Refactored BaobabLeaves and TermiteMound classes to be BaobabLeavesBlock and TermiteMoundBlock respectively.
